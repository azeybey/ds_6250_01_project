Exploring Birth Data Trends and Health Outcomes in the United States

The project aims to examine the "Births Data Summary" dataset, collected by the CDC, which contains vital information on live births within the United States to U.S. residents. This project will process and analyze the dataset to uncover patterns and trends related to maternal, paternal, and infant characteristics and their impact on health outcomes. These insights could be used to inform public health policies and interventions.
Project Description:
Focusing on the "Births Data Summary" dataset, this project investigates the relationship between demographic, health, and medical data on mothers, fathers, and infants and their corresponding health outcomes. By applying machine learning algorithms, the project will identify localities with higher rates of complicated and high-cost births, explore the role of social determinants of health, and suggest targeting strategies based on population characteristics.
This project aims to contribute to improved health outcomes for mothers and infants by uncovering insights into factors influencing birth outcomes and identifying potential public health interventions. A staged approach to implementation ensures that each step is carefully tested and optimized, contributing to the overall success and impact of the project.
